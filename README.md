## About this mod

This mod is an extension to my another project, [Project Diablo 2: Single Player+](https://github.com/Lukaszpg/PD2-Single-Player-Plus-mod). While Single Player+ contains only single player quality of life features without touching the balance, Sancutary of Exile expands on rich fundamentals od SPP+ and Vanilla PD2 by adding new ways of developing your character.

## Multiplayer

Most likely will not work properly even in TCP/IP.

## How to install

Head to [launcher repository](https://github.com/Lukaszpg/pd2-sanctuary-of-exile-launcher) and follow the instructions. This works right now only on Windows OS. If you have other operating system, please follow manual installation istructions below: 

a) With PlugY:

1. Copy your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.
2. Install PD2 Plugy for SP by BetweenWalls: https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY#pd2-plugy. WARNING - The materials tab introduced in S11 tab will not work with Plugy! 2a. If you already have Plugy installed and played previous versions of this mod, please remove the contents of shared stash and create a new character.
3. Head to "Releases" and download most recent version of this mod.
4. Paste the downloaded "pd2data.mpq" file to ProjectD2 folder at your client directory, that you've created at step one.
5. Create a shortcut to "Plugy.exe" from your ProjectD2 folder. Add "-3dfx -plugy" run parameter to your Plugy.exe shortcut.
6. Use the recommended loot filter from "Releases" (just paste the downloaded loot.filter file to your D2 client ProjectD2 folder) or adjust your personal loot filter, using new items codes on the bottom of this page (loot filter knowledge required).
7. Launch the game through the PlugY shortcut created in step 6.
8. Head to Akara and look for an item with Alkor's quest potion graphics. If it's there, mod was installed successfully. GLHF!

b) Without PlugY:

1. Copy your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.
2. Create shortcut for PD2 Launcher from the new directory.
3. Head to "Releases" and download most recent version of this mod.
4. Paste the downloaded "pd2data.mpq" file to ProjectD2 folder at your client directory, that you've created at step 1.
5. Use the recommended loot filter from "Releases" (just paste the downloaded loot.filter file to your D2 client ProjectD2 folder) or adjust your personal loot filter, using new items codes on the bottom of this page (loot filter knowledge required).
6. IMPORTANT Launch PD2 Launcher through the shortcut created in step 2, head to options and click "Disable Updates". Close options. Click Play.

**Solution:** Open PlugY.ini file in your ProjectD2 directory, look for `ActiveShiftClickLimit=1` and change it to `ActiveShiftClickLimit=0`.
